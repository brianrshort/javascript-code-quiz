# javascript-code-quiz

The goal of this coding quize was to use the DOM and interactive javascript code to create a dynamic, interactive web page..

I practiced and studied a number of skills during the execution of this assignment, including using objects, functions, event handlers (event listeners and callback functions), as well as multiple ways to select DOM elements and manipulate them dynamically. 

This project was completed as part of my work for MSU/Trilogy web development bootcamp course. A short note--I started this project without fully understanding many of the methods and went basically through two completely different versions of the site. If you sort through the commits, that's why it looks like that, because I rebuilt it twice from scratch. It was helpful, though, to realize how important it is to make sure every piece of what you're buidling works properly before you move on to build the next section/portion of it. (See below.)

04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
